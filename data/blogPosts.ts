    “It seems the whole galaxy is here to witness your death.<br>
    The moon and the stars and the creatures of the night.<br>
    If only you had put up a fight.<br>
    Now your lambs will be drawn to the slaughter.<br>
    Their blood will flow like water as mine gets hotter”
</p>
<p>
    “Is it customary for the executioner to rhyme before the fateful time?<br>
    I must say your words taste like a bitter lime.<br>
    Perhaps you’d be better off being a mime”
</p>
<p>
    “Even when your end is nigh you still keep your head up high.<br>
    Alas I’d prefer if you were shy before I chop your head off....oh my!<br>
    What a wonderful thought! You getting shot!<br>
    I have to say I’d like that a lot!”
</p>
<p>
    “Enough! Your poems have taken their toll!<br>
    I’d rather have my head roll!<br>
    Take my life and end this droll”
</p>
<p>
    “Your words have forced my hand!<br>
    Your wish is my command!<br>
    Off with your head then I’m off to bed!<br>
    Goodnight being of all white.<br>
    I hope you know what I’m doing is right”

    title: "I Exist",
    content: `<p>
    Trapped below the surface of consciousness,<br>
    Starved for lucidity,<br>
    This is not a dream,<br>
    Not a nightmare either
</p>
<p>
    The currents of time wash my body,<br>
    It's been a day,<br>
    A week,<br>
    A month,<br>
    Every moment like the last,<br>
    A torrent of monotony,<br>
    Waves of nothingness.
</p>
<p>
    I reach out to Grief,<br>
    She recoils at my touch,<br>
    She refuses to be felt,<br>
    Her corpse washes away,<br>
    Just as those who came before her
</p>
<p>
    Floating at sea,<br>
    Under the surface,<br>
    I exist,<br>
    That is all

    title: "Legacy",
    content: `<p>
    Is it possible to miss someone you've never met?<br>
    I certainly don't.<br>
    But his shadow looms over me.
</p>
<p>
    "You have his cheeks."<br>
    "You're just as funny as he was."<br>
    "You smile like he did"<br>
    Empty words with no memories for context.<br>
    Is that the legacy he has left me?<br>
    A mirror for others to remember him by?
</p>
<p>
    I don't miss him,<br>
    Though I long for him.<br>
    A tangible emptiness.<br>
    Amplified by her absence.
</p>
<p>
    I am who I am<br>
    Because I was raised by a shadow 22 years gone.
